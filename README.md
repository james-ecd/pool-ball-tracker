# Ball tracking technologies and explanations

- We'll use HSV instead of RGB as it allows use to give lower and upper boundaries of a colour defeined in the "HSV color space"
- OpenCV2 to process video streams
- deque for rapid pops/appends (to rapidly track and process ball coordinate data)
- numpy for additional data structures
